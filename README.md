# Ria's Radio

Here's my submission for my radio!

### What does it do?
- For each key, a different note is played

### Challenges 
- It was my first time ever making a schematic or a 3d model, so it was very challenging to figure out how the applications function and how to use the numerous tools. But at the end of it, I became pretty good at using Shapr3D and in the future I hope to use it more to make models. 

### PCB

Here is a picture of my schematic and PCB:
